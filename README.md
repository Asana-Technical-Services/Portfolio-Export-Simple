# Portfolio-Export-Simple
 
This script is a tool to extract project-level metadata from a nested portfolio structure in Asana. The main document is portfolio-export.html that calls a script in resources/index.js.

The javascript function uses the provided Personal Access Token and Portfolio link to pull Asana data using the Asana API and tranform it into a CSV format.

Open the html file in a browser page to get started - operating instructions are included in the HTML file.
